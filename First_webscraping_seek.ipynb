       " '\\nCOMPANY BACKGROUND\\nElectricity systems need flexibility\\nIn order to support the ongoing transition to renewable energy generation, all global electricity systems need increasing amounts of flexibility in how and when electricity is used. Businesses that can harness “power flexibility” to intelligently\\n            adjust when they use power from the electricity grid can significantly lower their cost of energy, creating a new source of competitive advantage. \\nAs Enel X, no one in the world can match our experience or our capabilities in building “virtual power plants” that generate value from power flexibility for both business customers and electricity systems. \\nEnel X Australia & New Zealand \\nAustralia’s electricity system is often front-page news. That’s because costs have skyrocketed, and there’s an ongoing debate about how to transition to renewables. Rather than engage in debates, Enel X is delivering innovative solutions to\\n            market that lower the cost of energy for Australian businesses, while also creating resources that support an accelerated transition to renewable energy. \\nWe entered the Australian market in 2011, operating until recently as EnerNOC. Enel purchased EnerNOC (formally a NASDAQ-listed technology company) in August 2017, and we now operate in Australia as Enel X. We are the clear market leader in\\n            power flexibility on both sides of the Tasman today, as measured by our market share, our technology or our market expertise. \\nMore broadly, we are helping businesses get the best return from investments in distributed energy resources (including energy storage, on-site renewable generation, and process flexibility). We succeed by leveraging our unique optimisation\\n            and trading platform, and our global strength as one of the world’s largest energy companies.\\nOur fundamental objective is to help business customers turn energy into a sustainable competitive advantage, and our ~40-person ANZ team is passionate about this goal.\\nEnel X\\nFormed in 2017, Enel X is a new business unit within the Enel Group focused on the transformation of the energy sector. Enel X has strong roots in the energy field and an open strategy geared towards digitalisation, sustainability and innovation.\\nEnel X focuses on three primary strategic objectives:\\n\\nTo assist customers in meeting goals for reduced energy costs and the decarbonisation of their energy use;\\nTo provide flexibility to the electricity grid to allow for a smooth integration of increasing quantities of renewable energy and distributed energy resources;\\nTo lead the global energy transition by acting as an accelerating agent for the electrification of diverse uses of energy;\\n\\nHeadquartered in Rome, Enel X currently has more than 2,000 employees working around the world. We are united by a common culture focused on customer centricity, data-driven decision-making, and an agile, collaborative working environment. More\\n            information is available at https://www.enelx.com\\n \\nThe Enel Group\\nHeadquartered in Rome, Enel is a multinational energy company. Enel is one of the 100 largest companies in the world, with business activities in 35 countries across 5 continents. \\nWhile Enel began as a traditional energy utility and it still has significant activities in these areas, it is now recognized as one of the leading renewable energy companies in the world, and today Enel manages approximately 43 GW of renewable\\n            power generation. \\nThe Enel Group is made up of approximately 69,000 people around the world whose brilliant work is based on the values of responsibility, innovation, trust and proactivity. Together, Enel’s people are working to overcome some of the greatest\\n            challenges facing the world, with an approach that combines attention to sustainability with the best in innovation.\\nEnel has been recognised by Fortune as one of the top 30 companies in the world that is using the profit motive to help the planet and tackle social problems: http://fortune.com/change-the-world/\\nMore information is available at: https://www.enel.com/\\n \\nPOSITION SUMMARY\\nEnel X has an immediate need for a Project Engineer, Demand Response to bolster our Asset Engineering & Operations team.
