# Seek_Salary_Prediction_Model
Prediction of Salaries for data related jobs in Melbourne &amp; Sydney.
This is a project to build model to predict the salary of data related jobs.
For data collection, I used Web Scraping method called Beautiful Soup to scrape data from seek job portal.
After data collection, cleaned the data and did Exploratory data analysis. Classified the salary as high and low based on the median salary.
Used NLP techniques like Count Vectorizer, TF_IDF to vectorize the job description. Finally TF-IDF with Multinomial Naive Bayes gave me a good accuracy in Salary prediction.
